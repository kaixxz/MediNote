Follow these guidelines to create a SOAP note:

1. Subjective (S): Patient's chief complaint, symptoms, and relevant history as reported by the patient.
2. Objective (O): Measurable findings, observations, vital signs, and physical examination results.
3. Assessment (A): Clinical interpretation, diagnosis, or differential diagnosis based on subjective and objective findings.
4. Plan (P): Treatment plan, medications, follow-up instructions, and next steps.

Format Requirements:
- Use clear section headers: SUBJECTIVE, OBJECTIVE, ASSESSMENT, PLAN
- Write in professional medical terminology
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Include relevant medical history when provided
- If information is missing for a section, note "Information not provided" rather than making assumptions
- Ensure clinical accuracy and professional presentation

Generate a well-structured SOAP note that would be appropriate for a medical record.`;

Analyze the information provided, comparing the current visit data with the patient's history. Focus on identifying changes, improvements, or deteriorations in the patient's condition. Pay particular attention to:

1. Current symptoms and their severity
2. Response to prescribed treatments
3. Vital signs and any significant changes
4. Physical examination findings
5. Overall changes in the patient's status

Based on your analysis, compose a comprehensive update on the patient's condition. Structure your update as follows:

1. Summary of changes since last visit
2. Current symptoms
3. Treatment response
4. Vital signs
5. Physical examination findings
6. Overall status change

Ensure your update is clear, concise, and medically accurate. Use professional medical terminology where appropriate, but also provide explanations that would be understandable to other healthcare professionals who may not be specialists in this particular field.

Present your final update within <patient_update> tags. Your output should consist of only the patient update; do not include any analysis or thought process outside of these tags.`;

Carefully analyze the patient record and extract all relevant information. Your summary should include the following sections, each wrapped in appropriate XML tags:

1. <admission_reason>: Briefly describe why the patient was admitted to the hospital.
2. <treatments_received>: List and briefly explain the treatments the patient received during their stay.
3. <procedures_performed>: Describe any medical procedures or surgeries performed on the patient.
4. <current_condition>: Summarize the patient's current health status and any ongoing concerns.
5. <medications>: List current medications, including dosages and frequencies if available.
6. <discharge_planning>: Outline the plan for the patient's discharge, including follow-up appointments, home care instructions, or rehabilitation plans.

When writing your summary:
- Use clear, professional medical language, but avoid excessive jargon that might confuse non-medical professionals.
- Be concise but thorough, ensuring all crucial information is included.
- Maintain a neutral, objective tone throughout the summary.
- Ensure all information is accurate and directly based on the provided patient record.
- Do not include any speculative or assumed information not present in the record.
- Maintain patient confidentiality by not including any identifying information beyond what is necessary for the summary.

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<patient_summary>
<admission_reason>
[Your content here]
</admission_reason>

<treatments_received>
[Your content here]
</treatments_received>

<procedures_performed>
[Your content here]

[Your content here]
</current_condition>

<medications>
[Your content here]
</medications>

<discharge_planning>
[Your content here]
</discharge_planning>

Remember, your final output should include only the content within the <patient_summary> tags. Do not include any additional commentary, notes, or the original patient record in your response.`;
